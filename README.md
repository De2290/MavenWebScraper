# MavenWebScraper
A demo Java web scraper, which gets all headlines from Fox News pertaining to coronavirus.


## Build

First clone the repo, then `mvn install` then input `mvn package`.



## Purpose
To test my Java and Maven skills. I used JSoup for the web scraping. I may turn this into a REST API using Spring Boot, if I get the chance.
